<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build BULL SAGE, an intelligent trading assistant. The initial goal was to create a dashboard with market analysis, an AI assistant, and other trading tools. The user's vision has since evolved into wanting a true **AI trading companion**. This super trader AI should provide in-depth, real-time analysis on a single selected asset, use a full suite of technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.), and give explicit BUY, SELL, or WAIT recommendations with justifications. The application must use **100% real data** from integrated APIs, with no mock data.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Dashboard:** Overview of markets, watchlist, and AI-summarized impactful news.
- **Trading Mode:** A dedicated page for in-depth, single-asset analysis with real-time technical indicators, price levels, and a detailed AI recommendation.
- **AI Assistant (BULL):** A powerful AI that analyzes market data and provides trading advice, summaries, and alerts.
- **Global Market Context:** Display key economic data (Fear & Greed, VIX, Fed Rate, etc.) and real-time news to inform trading decisions.
- **Educational Tooltips:** Provide explanations for all technical indicators and trading terms throughout the app.
- **Journal de Trading:** A professional trading journal to log trades, notes, and analyze performance statistics (Win Rate, P&L, etc.).
- **Cockpit / Alertes:** A central hub featuring a morning AI briefing and a system for creating and managing custom price and indicator-based alerts.
- **Modern UI:** Use modern, thin icons () and maintain a clean, minimalist design aesthetic.

**User's preferred language**: French. The next agent MUST respond in French.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB project named BULL SAGE. It features JWT authentication and a dark-themed UI.

Several key features have been implemented in this session:
- **Trading Mode:** A new, fully functional page that provides deep analysis of a selected cryptocurrency. It calculates and displays real-time technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, MA Trend) and uses an LLM to generate a clear BUY/SELL/WAIT recommendation with detailed reasoning.
- **Global Market Context & AI News:** The Trading Mode and Dashboard pages now feature a Global Market Context section displaying real-time economic data (Fear & Greed, VIX, Fed Rate, EUR/USD) and a section with AI-summarized news in French, highlighting market impact and recommended actions.
- **Educational Tooltips:** Tooltips have been added across the Trading Mode page to explain all technical indicators, price levels, and trading concepts.
- **Cockpit & Journal Pages:** The backend models and API endpoints for a professional Trading Journal and an advanced Alerting system have been created. The corresponding frontend pages (, ) have been built, showing the UI for the Morning AI Briefing, alert management, and trade journaling statistics.
- **UI Modernization:** All emojis have been successfully replaced with modern, thin  icons across the application.
- **Bug Fix:** A critical bug preventing users from searching for and adding cryptos to their watchlist (due to CoinGecko API rate limiting) was fixed by implementing a backend caching mechanism.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: Implementing Phase 1 of the Super Trader enhancements, which includes a **Professional Trading Journal** and a **Cockpit** page (for a morning AI briefing and smart alerts). The agent created the backend models, API endpoints, and the frontend pages with their UI layouts.
- **Status**: **IN PROGRESS**
- **Agent Testing Done**: N (Only visual confirmation via screenshots of the new UI layouts. No interactive testing of creating journal entries or alerts has been performed).
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1**: The fix for the CoinGecko API rate limit seems incomplete. While the Add to Watchlist modal was fixed, the main Dashboard page now shows crypto prices as /bin/bash.00, indicating the data is not being fetched or displayed correctly there. This is a regression. (**Priority: P0**)

  **Issues Detail**:
  - **Issue 1**: Dashboard crypto prices show /bin/bash.00.
     - **Attempted fixes**: A caching mechanism was added to  to solve the rate-limiting issue for the crypto list endpoint. However, this fix doesn't appear to be working for the data feed that populates the main dashboard watchlist prices.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
       1. Examine  to see which API endpoint it uses to fetch watchlist prices.
       2. Check the browser's network tab to see the response from that endpoint.
       3. Investigate the corresponding backend function in  that serves this data.
       4. Apply the same caching logic that fixed the  endpoint or find the new source of the rate-limiting error.
       5. Verify that the Dashboard correctly displays prices after the fix.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: The dashboard is the main entry point for the user. Displaying correct, real-time prices is critical for the application's usability and credibility.
     - **Status**: **NOT STARTED**
     - **Is recurring issue?**: Y (This is a recurrence of the CoinGecko rate-limiting problem).
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1**: Complete and test Super Trader Phase 1 features (Journal & Cockpit/Alerts). (**Priority: P1**)
  
 **Task Detail**:
  - **Task 1**:
     - **Where to resume**: The UI for  and  is built. The next step is to implement the frontend logic:
       - **Journal:** Wire up the Nouveau Trade button to a modal form, handle form submission to the  endpoint, and fetch/display the trade history in the table.
       - **Cockpit:** Wire up the + Nouvelle Alerte button to a modal, handle form submission to , and fetch/display existing alerts.
     - **What will be achieved with this?**: Users will have a fully functional trading journal and a smart alert system, core components of the AI trading companion vision.
     - **Status**: **IN PROGRESS**
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
     - **Blocked on something**: None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **P0: Implement Signal Performance Tracking:** Implement backend logic to track the performance of generated signals (Win/Loss status) and calculate the overall Win Rate.
    - **P1: Build out Paper Trading page:** Implement the full functionality for the placeholder page, including a virtual portfolio, simulated trades, and P&L tracking.
    - **P2: Build out Strategies page:** Implement UI and backend for creating, saving, and backtesting custom trading strategies.
    - **P3: Super Trader - Phase 2:** Implement advanced backtesting with strategy optimization suggestions from the AI.

- **Future Tasks**:
    - **Refactor :** Break down the monolithic  into a modular structure using FastAPI's  for better maintainability.
    - **Super Trader - Phase 3:** Implement social/copy-trading features and advanced portfolio analysis.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, Motor, JWT,  for technical analysis.
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, , , Shadcn/UI, Recharts.
- **Database:** MongoDB.
- **Core Feature:** Real-time data aggregation from multiple APIs to feed a GPT-based AI for providing trading signals, analysis, and summaries.

**changes in tech stack**
- Added  to backend dependencies for calculating technical indicators.

**All files of reference**

- : Modified to add the AI-summarized news section.
- : Modified to add links to the new pages.
- : Modified to add routes for the new pages.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file is now extremely large and complex. It urgently needs to be refactored into smaller, feature-specific modules using .

**key api endpoints**
- : **(NEW)** Provides in-depth analysis for a single asset.
- : **(NEW)** Provides AI-summarized news with market impact.
- : **(NEW)** CRUD endpoints for trading journal entries.
- : **(NEW)** CRUD endpoints for smart alerts.
- : **(NEW)** Generates the AI morning briefing.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user's highest priority is the AI trading companion vision. All new features should align with making the tool more analytical, proactive, and educational.
- The CoinGecko API rate limit is a persistent issue. The caching solution is a good start, but it needs to be robustly applied wherever crypto price data is fetched.
- The   library has a specific syntax (). Deviating from this pattern caused multiple errors and should be avoided.
- The user is highly engaged and provides excellent, detailed feedback. It is crucial to address their feedback directly and prioritize their requests.
