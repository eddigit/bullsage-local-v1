# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

## Test Session: 2025-12-15 20:05
### Implementation Summary:
1. **P0 COMPLETED: Emoji Replacement**
   - Replaced all emojis with modern lucide-react icons
   - Files modified: DashboardPage.jsx, MarketIntelligencePage.jsx, SettingsPage.jsx, SignalsPage.jsx
   - Fear & Greed emoji (😱) replaced with TrendingDown/ChevronUp icons
   - Warning emoji (⚠️) replaced with AlertTriangle icon
   - Status labels (✓, ✗) now use CheckCircle/XCircle icons

2. **P1 IN PROGRESS: Signal Performance Tracking**
   - Added `/api/signals/evaluate` endpoint in backend
   - Endpoint fetches current prices from CoinGecko
   - Compares prices against TP1, TP2, SL for BUY/SELL signals
   - Calculates PnL percentage
   - Auto-expires signals based on timeframe (1h/4h: 24h, daily: 7 days)
   - Added "Évaluer les signaux" button in SignalsPage.jsx
   - Added evaluation results display panel

### Tasks to Test:
1. **Emoji Replacement (P0)**: 
   - Check Dashboard page - Fear & Greed should show icon not emoji
   - Check Intelligence page - Fear & Greed history should show Gauge icon
   - Check Settings page - Warning should show AlertTriangle icon
   - Check Signals page - Status badges should have icons

2. **Signal Evaluation (P1)**:
   - Navigate to Signals page
   - Click "Évaluer les signaux" button
   - Should show evaluation results panel
   - Check unrealized PnL calculation

### test_plan:
  needs_retesting: true
  test_priority: "high_first"

### agent_communication:
  - agent: "main"
  - message: "Completed P0 (emoji replacement) and P1 (signal evaluation). Ready for testing."
